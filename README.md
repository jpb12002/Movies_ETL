# ETL - Extract, Transform, Load

## Overview of the Analysis
The Amazing Prime Video team wants to develop an algorithm to determine which upcoming movie releases will become popular. Our goal was to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a dataset that is easy to use. To do this, we followed the ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
